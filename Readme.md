## Fundamental Of Next.js 

Welcome to Next.js! 



We’re kicking off our journey with Fundamentals of Next.js — the first step toward mastering one of the most powerful React frameworks in today’s web development world.

In this module, you’ll discover why Next.js is a game-changer compared to plain React, learn how pre-rendering works, and get hands-on by building your very first Next.js app. From routing (basic, nested, dynamic, and even catch-all!) to understanding React server components, you’ll explore the core concepts that make Next.js stand out.



By the end, you’ll also be comfortable with navigation, group routing with layouts, and styling with built-in CSS modules. This module sets the foundation you’ll need to unlock all the advanced features coming up later in our Next.js journey.



Get ready to dive in — your Next.js adventure starts here!
